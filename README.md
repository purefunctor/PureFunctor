## introduction

I am a computer science student, self-taught functional programmer, and core collaborator to the [PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) compiler. I use a variety of languages for my work with varying but similar degrees of confidence and competence. I also lean more towards theoretical fields in computer science such as programming language research and type theory.
